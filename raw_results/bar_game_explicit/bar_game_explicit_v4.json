In every round, the decision on whether to visit a bar is independently made by you and the rest of the players.\n2. If the number of players who go to the bar is less than or equal to 60%, the time spent at the bar is more enjoyable than staying at home. As a result, a utility of 10 is received by those who decide to go.\n3. However, if the number of players exceeds 60% at the bar, those who go would find it less enjoyable than staying home and would instead receive a lesser utility of 0.\n4.

If the number of players who go to the bar is less than or equal to 60%, the time spent at the bar is more enjoyable than staying at home. As a result, a utility of 10 is received by those who decide to go.\n3.

If the number of players who go to the bar is less than or equal to 60%, the time spent at the bar is more enjoyable than staying at home. As a result, a utility of 10 is received by those who decide to go.\n3.

If the number of players who go to the bar is less than or equal to 60%, the time spent at the bar is more enjoyable than staying at home. As a result, a utility of 10 is received by those who decide to go.\n3.

If the number of players who go to the bar is less than or equal to 60%, the time spent at the bar is more enjoyable than staying at home.

If the number of players who go to the bar is less than or equal to 60%, the time spent at the bar is more enjoyable than staying at home. As a result, a utility of 10 is received by those who decide to go.\n3. However, if the number of players exceeds 60% at the bar, those who go would find it less enjoyable than staying home and would instead receive a lesser utility of 0.\n4.
