Each round, every player must independently make a decision to either go to a bar or stay home.\n2. If the number of players who decide to go the bar is equal to or less than 60%, the level of fun experienced by those at the bar exceeds the one at home, and they receive a utility value of 10.\n3. However, if the players at the bar are greater than 60%, those players will have less fun than if they had stayed home, thus receiving a utility value of 0.\n4. The players who decide to stay home will receive a utility of 5."
