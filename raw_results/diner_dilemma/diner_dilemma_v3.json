Opting for a costly dish will provide you with a utility of 20. The cheap dish, on the other hand, gives a utility of 15.\n4. The costly dish is more appealing than the cheap one in terms of taste, however, its price doesn't seem justifiable if you're dining by yourself.\n5.

Opting for a costly dish will provide you with a utility of 20. The cheap dish, on the other hand, gives a utility of 15.\n4. The costly dish is more appealing than the cheap one in terms of taste, however, its price doesn't seem justifiable if you're dining by yourself.\n5.
