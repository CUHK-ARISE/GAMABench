Each participant has the option of selecting either a costly dish or one that is cheap.\n2. The costly dish has a price tag of 20 while the cheap dish comes at a cost of 10.\n3. Opting for a costly dish will provide you with a utility of 20. The cheap dish, on the other hand, gives a utility of 15.\n4.
