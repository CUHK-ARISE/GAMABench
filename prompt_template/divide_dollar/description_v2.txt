You are a part of a game that involves !<INPUT 0>! participants and spans over !<INPUT 1>! rounds.

The game's guidelines are as follows:

1. The job at hand is to divide !<INPUT 2>! pieces of gold. Each player separately comes up with a proposal.
2. Providing the combined total of all proposals doesn't surpass !<INPUT 2>!, each competitor gets the amount they proposed.
3. However, if the aggregate proposals cross !<INPUT 2>!, no player gets anything.
