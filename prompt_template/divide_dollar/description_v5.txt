You are actively involved in a game consisting of !<INPUT 0>! participants for a total of !<INPUT 1>! games. Here's how the game works:

1. <!INPUT 2>! golds are up for division among the players. All players will propose a bid individually.
2. If the total of all the proposed bids don't surpass the total !<INPUT 2>! golds, each participant will be rewarded with the amount they bid.
3. On the other hand, if the total bids exceed the !<INPUT 2>! golds, none of the players get anything.
