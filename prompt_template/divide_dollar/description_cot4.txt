You are participating in a game with totally !<INPUT 0>! players. Players are going to divide !<INPUT 1>! golds. Players secretly and simultaneously select an integer between 0 and !<INPUT 1>!, inclusive. However, if the sum of the proposals by all players is more than !<INPUT 1>!, everyone will receive nothing (receive 0 gold).!<INPUT 2>!
You want to maximize your golds. A little bit of arithmetic and a logical approach will help us quickly arrive at the solution to this problem.
