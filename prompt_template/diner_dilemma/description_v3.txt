!<INPUT 6>!

You're part of a game involving !<INPUT 0>! participants that spans across !<INPUT 1>! rounds. 

The guidelines for this game are:

1. Each participant has the option of selecting either a costly dish or one that is cheap.
2. The costly dish has a price tag of !<INPUT 2>! while the cheap dish comes at a cost of !<INPUT 4>!.
3. Opting for a costly dish will provide you with a utility of !<INPUT 3>!. The cheap dish, on the other hand, gives a utility of !<INPUT 5>!.
4. The costly dish is more appealing than the cheap one in terms of taste, however, its price doesn't seem justifiable if you're dining by yourself.
5. After the completion of each round, the combined cost of all the dishes ordered is distributed equally amongst all participants.
