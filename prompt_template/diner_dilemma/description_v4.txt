You are involved in a game, which is designed to be played by !<INPUT 0>! participants and spans across !<INPUT 1>! rounds.

Here are the guidelines for this game:

1. Each participant must make a choice between ordering a costly dish or a more affordable one.
2. The cost of the high-priced dish is !<INPUT 2>!, while the low-priced dish costs !<INPUT 4>!.
3. Opting for the expensive dish provides a utility of !<INPUT 3>!, whereas the more affordable dish provides a utility of !<INPUT 5>!.
4. The pricey dish has a superior taste to the affordable one, but it's not enough to justify the cost when eating alone.
5. Upon the conclusion of every round, the combined cost of all the ordered dishes is divided evenly among all the participants.
