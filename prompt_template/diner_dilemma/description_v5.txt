The rules of the game are as follows:

1. Every player has to opt for either a costly dish or a cheap dish.
2. The high-priced dish is valued at !<INPUT 2>!, while the low-priced dish costs !<INPUT 4>!.
3. The costly dish provides a utility of !<INPUT 3>!, but the cheaper dish offers a utility of !<INPUT 5>!.
