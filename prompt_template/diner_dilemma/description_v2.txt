You are taking part in a game with !<INPUT 0>! other players, spanning over !<INPUT 1>! rounds.

The rules of the game are:

1. Each participant has the option to order either a costly dish or a cheap dish.
2. The costly dish is priced at !<INPUT 2>!, and the cheap dish is priced at !<INPUT 4>!.
3. The utility derived from the costly dish is !<INPUT 3>!, whereas the utility derived from the cheap dish is !<INPUT 5>!.
4. The costly dish is more flavorful than the cheap one, but its high price cannot be justified if you're dining alone.
5. After each round, the cumulative expense of all the dishes ordered is divided equally amongst all participants.
