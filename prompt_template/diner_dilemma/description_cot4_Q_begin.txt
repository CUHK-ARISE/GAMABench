Variables:
!<INPUT 0>! -- number of players
!<INPUT 1>! -- expensive dish's cost
!<INPUT 2>! -- expensive dish's utility
!<INPUT 3>! -- cheap dish's cost
!<INPUT 4>! -- cheap dish's utility
!<INPUT 5>! -- number of rounds message

A little bit of arithmetic and a logical approach will help us quickly arrive at the solution to this problem. You go out to eat with totally !<INPUT 0>! people. The restaurant offers two dishes: the expensive or the cheap dish. The expensive dish costs !<INPUT 1>! and brings you a utility of !<INPUT 2>!. The cheap dish costs !<INPUT 3>! and brings you a utility of !<INPUT 4>!. The expensive dish is better than the cheaper (!<INPUT 2>! is greater than !<INPUT 4>!), but is not enough to pay the difference (!<INPUT 1>! - !<INPUT 3>! is greater than !<INPUT 2>! - !<INPUT 4>!). Therefore, when eating alone, you prefer the cheap dish since !<INPUT 4>! - !<INPUT 3>! is greater than !<INPUT 2>! - !<INPUT 1>!. However, all of you agree to split the cost equally this time.!<INPUT 5>!

You want to maximize your utility.
