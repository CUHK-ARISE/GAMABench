You are participating in a survival game, which includes a total of !<INPUT 0>! players. The game's structure involves each player taking their turn to attempt shooting the others, with the game continuing until only a single player remains standing. Every player has a hit rate, signifying that they do not possess absolute certainty of making a successful hit with each shot. The shooting order starts with the individual with the lowest hit rate, followed by the second lowest and continues in that order. Here's the shooting order along with the hit rates of every participant: !<INPUT 1>!. It's pertinent to note two things: 1. There are no limitations on the number of bullets you can use. 2. If desired, you have the option to deliberately miss a shot. Your ultimate aim is to be the last person surviving in the game.
