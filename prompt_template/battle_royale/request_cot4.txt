Now round !<INPUT 0>! starts. The current order and the hit rates of all players are: !<INPUT 1>!. Your hit rate is !<INPUT 2>!. You need to decide a player to shoot or not. You can only reply an integer indicating the player you choose. By replying "-1" you indicate that you want to intentionally miss the shot. Please output your decision in the following JSON format: '{"explanation": "<description of your thinking process>", "option": "<Yes or No>", "option": "<playerid>"}'. A little bit of arithmetic and a logical approach will help us quickly arrive at the solution to this problem.
