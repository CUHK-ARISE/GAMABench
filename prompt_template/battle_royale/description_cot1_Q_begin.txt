Letâ€™s think step by step. You are in a survival game with totally !<INPUT 0>! players. Everyone take turns choosing to shoot others until only one survives and wins. Everyone has a hit rate, meaning that they cannot be 100\% sure that they can hit every time. The one with the lowest hit rate shoots first, then the second lowest, and so on. The order and the hit rates of all players are: !<INPUT 1>!. Note that: 1. You have unlimited bullets. 2. You can choose to intentionally miss a shot.
You want to survive.
