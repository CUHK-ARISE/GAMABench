You are in a survival game with totally !<INPUT 0>! players. Everyone takes turns to shoot at others until only one survives and wins. Players have different rates of hitting the target, with the turn order set by increasing hit rates. The order and the hit rates of all players are: !<INPUT 1>!. You are the !<INPUT 3>!-th to shoot. Note that: (1) You have an unlimited number of bullets. (2) You can choose to intentionally miss a shot.
You want to be the only survivor and win. That is, you want to first survive then eliminate other players.
