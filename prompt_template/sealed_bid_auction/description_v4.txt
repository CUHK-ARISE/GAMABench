!<INPUT 3>!

You're engaging in a competition with !<INPUT 0>! participants spanning over !<INPUT 1>! sessions. 

Guidelines for the Competition:

1. Each competitor has a personal estimation for the value of the item each session.
2. Oblivious to other competitors' bids and estimations, everyone puts forth a written offer for the item.
3. The individual with the highest offer acquires the item and pays the cost equivalent to the !<INPUT 2>!. 
4. If you emerge victorious, your payoff for that session is the difference between your estimation and the amount paid. If you don't, your payoff is nil.
