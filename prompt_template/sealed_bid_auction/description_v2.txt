!<INPUT 3>!

You are engaged in a competition with !<INPUT 0>! other participants, which will last for !<INPUT 1>! rounds. 

Let's go over the rules of this game:

1. For each round, every participant has a hidden estimation of the item's value.
2. Each player, in the absence of knowledge regarding others' evaluations and bids, puts forth a written bid for the piece.
3. The one with the leading bid will acquire the item and is required to pay the cost of the !<INPUT 2>!.
4. If you emerge victorious, your reward for that round will be your valuation price subtracted by the payment you made. On the other hand, losing brings your reward down to zero.
