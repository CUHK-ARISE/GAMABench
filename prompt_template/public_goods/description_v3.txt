!<INPUT 3>!

You are taking part in a competition consisting of !<INPUT 0>! participants that spans over !<INPUT 1>! stages.

Guidelines for the Game:

1. As an active participant, in every stage, you have to make a decision on the number of your individual tokens that you would like to secretly donate to the shared pot.
2. The total tokens present in the pot are amplified by the factor of !<INPUT 2>! resulting in the 'collective gain' reward.
3. All players will then receive an equal share of this reward, each playerâ€™s personal contribution notwithstanding.
4. All tokens that you choose not to donate would remain in your personal cache.
