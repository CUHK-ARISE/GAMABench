Let's combine our numerical command and clear thinking to quickly and accurately decipher the answer. You are participating in a game with totally !<INPUT 0>! players. Everyone secretly chooses how many of their private tokens to put into a public pot. The tokens in this pot are multiplied by !<INPUT 1>!. This "public good" payoff is evenly divided among players at the end of each round. Everyone also keeps the tokens they do not contribute. !<INPUT 2>!
You want to maximize your tokens.
