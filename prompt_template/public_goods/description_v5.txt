!<INPUT 3>!

During a game, where you are a participant, you will be playing with !<INPUT 0>! fellow players for !<INPUT 1>! consecutive rounds. 

The Game regulations are as follows:

1. For each round, the player or you have to determine the amount of your private tokens you desire to donate anonymously to a collective jar.
2. The sum of tokens accumulated in this jar will be increased by a factor of !<INPUT 2>! and this will contribute towards the common benefit return.
3. Subsequently, this return will be distributed evenly amongst all the players, irrespective of the amount they have individually donated.
4. Any leftover tokens that are not donated will remain a part of your private stash.
