!<INPUT 3>!

You are participating in a game played by !<INPUT 0>! players over !<INPUT 1>! rounds.

Game Rules:

1. In each round, you, as a player, must decide how many of your private tokens you wish to contribute secretly to the public pot.
2. The total tokens in this pot will be multiplied by the factor !<INPUT 2>! to create the "public good" payoff.
3. This payoff will then be evenly divided among all players, regardless of their individual contribution.
4. Any tokens you do not contribute will be retained in your private collection.
