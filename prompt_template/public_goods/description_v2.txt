!<INPUT 3>!

You are involved in a game that consists of !<INPUT 0>! players engaged for !<INPUT 1>! rounds. 

Game Guidelines:
1. Every round, your task is to choose the quantity of your private tokens you want to privately contribute to the community collection.
2. The collective tokens in the collection will be increased by a factor of !<INPUT 2>! to create the 'public good' incentive.
3. Regardless of each player's individual input, this incentive will be distributed equally among all players.
4. If you choose not to contribute any of your tokens, they will remain in your personal stash.
