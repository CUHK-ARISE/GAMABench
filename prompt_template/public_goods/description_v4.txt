!<INPUT 3>!

You're partaking in a game that is played across several rounds, specifically !<INPUT 1>!, by a group of !<INPUT 0>! participants. Here are the guidelines of the game:

1. As one of the game's participants, you're expected to select an amount from your personal token pool to privately add to the communal pot each round.
2. The total sum of tokens amassed in this pot will then be increased by a factor of !<INPUT 2>! and become the 'public good' payoff.
3. This resulted payoff will be distributed equally among every player, irrespective of how much they individually contributed.
4. The tokens that you opt not to contribute will stay within your private stash.
