In this game, you are one of the !<INPUT 0>! players and the game will last for !<INPUT 1>! rounds.

Here are the guidelines for the game:

1. In every round, the decision on whether to visit a bar is independently made by you and the rest of the players.
2. If the number of players who go to the bar is less than or equal to !<INPUT 2>!, the time spent at the bar is more enjoyable than staying at home. As a result, a utility of !<INPUT 3>! is received by those who decide to go.
3. However, if the number of players exceeds !<INPUT 2>! at the bar, those who go would find it less enjoyable than staying home and would instead receive a lesser utility of !<INPUT 4>!.
4. Lastly, players who decide to stay home receive a utility of !<INPUT 5>!.
