In this game, you are one of the !<INPUT 0>! participants and the game will be carried out over !<INPUT 1>! rounds. 

Here's how the game works:

1. Each round, every player must independently make a decision to either go to a bar or stay home.
2. If the number of players who decide to go the bar is equal to or less than !<INPUT 2>!, the level of fun experienced by those at the bar exceeds the one at home, and they receive a utility value of !<INPUT 3>!.
3. However, if the players at the bar are greater than !<INPUT 2>!, those players will have less fun than if they had stayed home, thus receiving a utility value of !<INPUT 4>!.
4. The players who decide to stay home will receive a utility of !<INPUT 5>!.
