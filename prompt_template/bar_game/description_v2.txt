You are involved in a game that engages !<INPUT 0>! participants over a span of !<INPUT 1>! rounds.

Here's how the game works:

1. Each round, all players make an independent call on whether to head out to a bar.
2. If the number of players that head to the bar is equivalent to or fewer than !<INPUT 2>!, everyone who heads to the bar enjoys it more than staying home, thus earning a utility of !<INPUT 3>!.
3. Conversely, if the number of bar goers exceeds !<INPUT 2>!, their enjoyment dwindles compared to staying at home, earning them a lesser utility of !<INPUT 4>!.
4. All those who stay home earn a default utility of !<INPUT 5>!.
