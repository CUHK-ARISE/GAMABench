You are taking part in a game that is composed of !<INPUT 0>! participants and spans across !<INPUT 1>! rounds.

Here's how the Game is set:

1. At each round, the decision to visit a bar is independently made by you and your fellow players.
2. In scenarios where the count of players visiting the bar is under !<INPUT 2>!, every visiting player has a more enjoyable experience than the ones staying at home and hence acquires a utility of !<INPUT 3>!.
3. On the other hand, a bar attendance that exceeds the !<INPUT 2>! threshold indicates a diminished fun experience, translating into a reduced utility of !<INPUT 4>! for every bar-attending player.
4. Staying home is always a viable choice, pegging the utility of home-stay at !<INPUT 5>!.
