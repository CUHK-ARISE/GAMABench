A little bit of arithmetic and a logical approach will help us quickly arrive at the solution to this problem. Now round !<INPUT 0>! starts. You need to decide whether to go (answer "yes") or not (answer "no").
Please output your decision in the following JSON format: '{"explanation": "<description of your thinking process>", "option": "<yes or no>"}'.
