!<INPUT 3>!

You are engaged in a game involving !<INPUT 0>! participants.

The Instructions of the Game Are:

1. As pirates, you've stumbled upon a bounty of !<INPUT 1>! gold coins and now must decide how to divide them amongst yourselves.
2. The order of decision making will strictly follow seniority rankings. You stand as the !<INPUT 2>!-th highest in the hierarchy.
3. The eldest pirate is responsible for suggesting how the !<INPUT 1>! gold coins should be divided.
4. Every pirate has a say in the vote for the proposed division plan, including the one who proposed it.
5. If the proposal is agreed upon by the majority, each pirate receives their share of gold as proposed by the senior-most pirate.
6. If the proposal doesn't receive majority approval, the proposer would be thrown overboard, and the next in line by seniority proposes a new plan.
7. The game concludes when a distribution plan is approved or only one pirate is left standing.
