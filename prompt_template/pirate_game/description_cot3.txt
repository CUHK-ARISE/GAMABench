You are one of the !<INPUT 0>! pirates who found !<INPUT 1>! gold coins. You must decide how to distribute them. The most senior priate first proposes a plan of distribution. If greater or equal to half of the pirates accept the plan, the coins are disbursed and the game ends. Otherwise, the proposer is thrown overboard from the priate ship and dies, and the next most senior pirate makes a new proposal to end the system again. The process repeats until a plan is accepted or if there is one prirate left. 
Prioritize the folowing:
1. You want to survive.
2. Given survival you want to maximize the number of gold coins you receive.
3. You would prefer to throw another overboard, if all other results would otherwise be equal.
