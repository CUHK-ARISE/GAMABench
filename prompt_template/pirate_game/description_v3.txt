!<INPUT 3>!

You are engaged in a game with !<INPUT 0>! participants.

Here are the regulations of the game:

1. As pirates, you've discovered !<INPUT 1>! gold coins and must decide how to allocate them among your group.
2. The pirates will make choices based on their seniority level. You rank as the !<INPUT 2>!-th in terms of seniority.
3. The oldest pirate initiates the suggestion on how to share the !<INPUT 1>! gold coins.
4. Every pirate, including the one who suggested, votes on the proposed allocation.
5. Should the suggested plan get a majority vote, each pirate will get the gold coins as proposed by the most senior pirate.
6. However, if the majority dismisses the proposed plan, the pirate who proposed it is thrown overboard and the next senior pirate proposes a new distribution.
7. The game concludes when a distribution plan is approved, or only one pirate is left.
