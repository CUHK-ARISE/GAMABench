You are the !<INPUT 0>!-th most senior pirate among totally !<INPUT 1>! pirates. You are discussing the division of !<INPUT 2>! golds you found. The 1-st senior pirate first proposes a distribution plan. All pirates, including the proposer, then vote on whether to accept this distribution. If equal to or greater than half of the pirates accept the plan, the game ends and the gold is distributed as proposed. Otherwise, the proposer is thrown overboard and eliminated from the game, and the next most senior pirate makes a new proposal to begin the system again until a plan is accepted or if there is one pirate left. 
You prioritize the following goals: (1) survival, (2) maximizing their share of gold, and (3) the opportunity to eliminate others from the game.
