Within a group of !<INPUT 1>! pirates, your rank is !<INPUT 0>!. The topic of conversation is how to divide the !<INPUT 2>! pieces of gold that have been discovered. The oldest pirate initiates the discussion with a proposed distribution. Every pirate, including the one who proposed the plan, votes to either accept or reject the plan. If half or more pirates favor the plan, it is implemented and the game concludes with the gold being shared as planned. If the plan does not garner sufficient support, the pirate who proposed it is removed from the game, being cast overboard. Afterwards, the pirate next in line of seniority proposes a new plan and the process is repeated until a consensus is reached or only one pirate remains. Your main objectives are: staying alive, getting the maximum possible share of the gold, and having the chance to eliminate other pirates from the game.
