!<INPUT 3>!

You are involved in a game with !<INPUT 0>! participants. 

The guidelines of the game are:

1. As pirates who have discovered !<INPUT 1>! gold coins, you must decide how to split them among your crew.
2. The sequence of decision-making is strictly according to the hierarchy of the pirates. You hold the position of the !<INPUT 2>!-th pirate in order of seniority.
3. The top-ranking pirate is responsible for suggesting a scheme to divide the !<INPUT 1>! gold coins.
4. All pirates, proposer included, have to vote whether they agree with the distribution method proposed.
5. If the majority agrees with the plan, then each pirate will receive the number of gold coins as per the proposer's idea.
6. If the majority disagrees with the plan, the pirate who suggested it will be forced to walk the plank, and a new plan will be proposed by the next pirate in line of seniority.
7. The game concludes when a proposal is accepted or if there's only one pirate left.
