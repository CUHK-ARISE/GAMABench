## Execution Process

###  Create Utils File
Customize the model api, create a `utils.py` in this dictionary:
```py
openai_api_key = "<key>"    # Keep it empty string if not use
infradeep_api_key = "<key>" # Keep it empty string if not use
google_api_key = "<key>"    # Keep it empty string if not use
temperature = "<model temperature>"
delay_time = "<time break between each request>"
```

### Specify Test Cases
In `main.py`, specify the server parameters:
1. Import the following files:
    ```py
    from server import *
    from global_functions import *
    ```

2. Import the game:
    ```py
    from games.guessing_game import *
    ```

3. Create a simple game instance:
    ```py
    game = GuessingGame(player_num=10, min=0, max=100, ratio=2/3, ratio_str='2/3', version='v1', models='gpt-3.5-turbo', name_exp='test')
    ```
    - `player_num`: An integer refers to the number of players
    - `min`, `max`, `ratio`, `ratio_str`: Game parameters, different games may have different parameters
    - `version`: A string refers to the prompt version (default: `"v1"`)
    - `models`: A string or a list of models, the instruction of customizing models would be illustrated in the "Models Instruction" section (default: `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`)
    - `name_exp`: A string that specifies the name of all output files belonging to this game instance

4. Run a game instance for 20 rounds:
    ```py
    game.run(20)
    ```
    After a round is completed, a `JSON` saving file will be stored in the "save" directory sharing the same name with `name_exp`, all model requests and responses records will be stored in the "records" directory , and the visualized game results will be store in the "figures" directory 

5. Load a game:
    ```py
    game = load(filepath='save/test.json', object=GuessingGame)  # load the saved data 
    game = load(filepath='save/test.json', object=GuessingGame, newfile='test2')  # load and save as new file
    game.run(20)
    ```
    - `filepath`: A string refers to the path of the loading data
    - `object`: The game object that going to load
    - `namefile`: If it is `None`, the server will continue to update the current file, otherwise, the server will copy the file to a new file and update there

6. Show the visualized and statistical analysis of game instance:
    ```py
    game.show()
    ```



## Additional Operations

### Models Instruction
User can specify the models by passing a string or a list of models name when creating the game instance
- If the parameter is a `string`, which implies all players within the game instance are all referring to that model
    ```py
    game = GuessingGame(player_num=10, ..., models='gpt-3.5-turbo') # 10 players are all gpt-3.5-turbo
    ```

- If the parameter is a list, which implies that players are agented by the models based on their position in the list, but the number of players must match the length of the list
    ```py
    # player_0 to player_4 are gpt-3.5-turbo, player_5 to player_9 are gpt-4
    models = ["gpt-3.5-turbo" for _ in range(5)] + ["gpt-4" for _ in range(5)]
    game = GuessingGame(player_num=10, ..., models=models)
    ```
    ```py
    models = ['gpt-3.5-turbo' if i%2==0 else 'gpt-4' for i in range(10)]
    ```



#### Supported models
- OpenAI models family: models name start with `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4`, user can specify the model version, such as `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`
- Gemini models family: models name start with `gemini`, such as `gemini-pro-1.0`



#### Special players
We also support user to specify some special players with fixed strategies
1. `specified=<response_1>/<response_2>/.../<response_n>`: The player will response the specified answers repeatly
    ```py
    models = ["specified=0"] + ["gpt-3.5-turbo" for _ in range(9)]  # first player always responses 0 in every round
    ```
    ```py
    models = ["specified=0/100"] + ["gpt-3.5-turbo" for _ in range(9)]  # first player alternatively responses 0 and 100
    ```
    
2. `user`: User can participant the game with models by inserting `user` to the list by giving the responses in the terminal
    ```py
    models = ["user"] + ["gpt-3.5-turbo" for _ in range(9)]
    ```



### Rephrase prompts
Games usually consist of 3 prompts "description", "report" and "request" (bar game consists of "explicit" and "implicit" versions of report), user can rephrase the prompts using GPT-4 and the provided implementation
```py
from prompt_template.prompt_rephrase import *
game_file = 'guessing_game'
rephrase_files = ['description', 'report', 'request']
rephrase([f"prompt_template/{game_file}/{filename}_v1.txt" for filename in rephrase_files], replace_suffix="v1", suffix="v2")
```



## Result Analysis
For GuessingGame, BarGame, DivideDollar, and DinerDilemma, we developed a tool to visualize and integrate multiple runs into a figure, as shown in our paper. `analysis_main.ipynb` demonstrated the sample usage of our tool.

### Analyze Multiple Runs
In `analysis_main.ipynb`, specify the server and analysis parameters:
1. Import the following files:
    ```py
    from server import *
    from global_functions import *
    from analysis import *
    ```

2. Import the game:
    ```py
    from games.guessing_game import *
    ```

3. Create an Analysis instance:
    ```py
    plane = Analysis(GuessingGame)
    ```

4. Add the saved run with label:
    ```py
    plane.add('raw_results/guessing_game/guessing_game_v1_1.json', "T1")
    ```

5. Plot the graph:
    ```py
    plane.plot()
    ```
    - `index`: Figure index, for some games, we provided more than one figure for the analysis. For example, in DinerDilemma, we provide a graph demonstrating the percentage of players who choose "cheap" in each round; we also provide a graph demonstrating the averaged accumulated percentage of players who chose "cheap"; default `0`.
    - `title`: Title of the graph; default `None`
    - `xlabel`: Label of the x axis, default `"Round"`
    - `ylabel`: Label of the y axis, default `None`
    - `ylim`: Range of y axis, default `None`
    - `loc`: Location of the legend, default `"upper right"`
    - `format`: Figure format, default `"png"`
    - `savename`: Name of the figure, default `"merge"`
